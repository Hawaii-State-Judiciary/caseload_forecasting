###Case filings for FY24

The SQL file contains a query that outputs the xlsx file, which is a caselist of FY24 filings for certain case types (CV, PC, DV, TC, TI, and TP). The RProj and R files take the xlsx file as input and output the csv, which is a frequency table of new filings for each of the case types.
