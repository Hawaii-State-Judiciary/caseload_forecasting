# Caseload Forecasting Project
For sharing data, scripts, and documentation. For storing readings and other resources. 

### Goals
The overarching goal of this project is to develop accurate caseload projections that the Judiciary can use to effectively plan for the future. To that end, there are multiple sub-goals:

**Sub-goals**
* Develop multiple caseload forecasting models using a variety of methods including time-series forecasting and other statistical models; forecasting tournaments, prediction markets, and related aggregation/wisdom-of-the-crowd methods; and heuristics.
* Assess the accuracy of these models on a monthly, quarterly, and yearly basis and refine as needed.
* Apply these models to forecast caseloads, case age, and other variables for the purpose of planning.

There are a number of proximate, concrete project goals. They include the following:
***For the Judiciary's Multi-year Program and Financial Plan (PFP)***
* Generate 5 year projections for caseloads in each ciruit and in the appellate courts.
* Generate 5-year projections for time to disposition in the trial courts and time to decision in appellate courts.
